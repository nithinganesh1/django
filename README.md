## Starting out with Django

This repository contains my learning code for Django. I am a beginner, so the code may not be perfect, but I am always learning and improving. I have a background in data science and ML, so I am excited to learn how to use Django to build web applications that can leverage my data science and ML skills.

Django is a Python web framework that makes it easy to build fast, secure, and scalable websites. It is used by some of the biggest websites in the world, including Instagram, Pinterest, and Mozilla.

I am excited to learn Django and to build some cool websites with it. If you are interested in Django too, I encourage you to check out my code and to contribute your own.
